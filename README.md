This program collects, sorts and displays data for highschools in a district. It includes metrics such as student scores, school type, and school budget. More tables are created for spending ranges per student to student scores, school size to student scores, school type to student scores, and scores by grade. The data shows that as schools get paid less per student, their grades go up. Thats fun. I also see that, while medium and small schools perform about the same. Large schools seem to suck. Comeing from a small school myself. I wonder if this has anythinhg to do with the school pushing kids through grades and making it easy to pass. I mean i almost never did homework in highschool and i still almost graduated. School that are larger or have more money may be more stricked on their students. District schools seem to have. Charter schools seem to do overwealmingly better overall. They are also mostly small or deium schools so it may be hard to draw a corelation there. Charter schools get less money and are smaller, their students also perform better. Is this because of the money, the size, or the school type? Who knows. All in all i think it is difficult to come to any concrete conclusions. The sample size is small and the opportunaty for coincidence is high.
